# Music-Genre-Classification
###Introduction
The Music Genre Classification and Recommendation System is an innovative machine learning project aimed at classifying music genres and providing personalized song recommendations based on a user's preferences. This project leverages the power of the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for genre classification, utilizes the librosa library for feature extraction, employs the Random Forest algorithm to select important features, and recommends songs from a self-created CSV dataset.
